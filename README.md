# Random-Quote-Generator
Random Quote Generator: Created a page that displays a random quote every time you click a button. Added some animations and pulled quotes from an API.


1. Basic Setup:
HTML: Set up a simple structure. You’ll need a container for your quote and a button to fetch a new one.
CSS: Style it up, make it look sexy. Maybe a nice font for the quotes, some padding, and a stylish button. Don’t forget to add a little hover effect—gotta keep things interesting, right?
2. JavaScript Magic:
Fetch a Quote: You’ll use JavaScript to fetch a random quote. Start simple: you could create an array of quotes and pick one at random.
Display the Quote: Once you’ve got your quote, display it in your container. Every time the button is clicked, a new quote pops up. Simple but effective, huh?
3. Spicing It Up:
Animations: Here’s where things get fun. Add a little fade-in effect when the new quote appears. Maybe a little bounce on the button when you click it. Make the interaction smooth and satisfying.
4. Extra Flavor:
Backgrounds & Colors: Change the background color or image with each new quote. Keep things fresh, yeah?
Fonts & Icons: Use Google Fonts for something classy and throw in some icons from Font Awesome if you’re feeling fancy.
5. Final Touches:
Responsive Design: Make sure it looks good on all devices. You don’t want your brilliance going to waste on a tiny screen, do you?
Deploy: Get that baby online! You can use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any hosting service you like. Show the world what you’ve got.
